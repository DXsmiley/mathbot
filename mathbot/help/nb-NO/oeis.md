# OEIS

The `{{prefix}}oeis` command is used to search the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

Currently, the command only returns the "most relevent" search result.

## Examples

`{{prefix}}oeis 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89`

`{{prefix}}oeis ackermann sequence`

Adding commas between numbers (`1, 2, 3`), as opposed to ommitting them (`1 2 3`) may produce different results.
