# Calculator

The calculator can be invoked with the command `{{prefix}}calc`. It supports performing operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on numbers.

A number of functions such as `abs(x)` and `sin(x)` can be used as well.

Constants such as `pi`, `i`, and `e` are defined.

For the extended list of features, see `=help calc-more`.
