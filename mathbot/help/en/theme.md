# Themes

The `{{prefix}}theme` command is used to change the colour of the results for the `{{prefix}}tex` and `{{prefix}}wolf` commands.

Use `{{prefix}}theme dark` to apply the dark theme.
Use `{{prefix}}theme light` to apply the light theme.

The colours are designed to match Discord's dark and light schemes respectively.

Note that this only impacts commands that *you* invoke. If someone else calls one of the above commands, the results with use their chosen theme.
